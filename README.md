# FCC - Build a Budget App Project

This is my solution for building this project. The full description of the task can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/build-a-budget-app-project/build-a-budget-app-project).

**NOTE**: This was written before the course was revamped to use their FCC's site. Previously, this was uploaded to Replit's site before they changed their free tier.

## How to run the project

1. Clone this repository to a location of your choice.

2. Create a virtual environement:

        python -m venv <virtual_environment_directory>

3. Activate the environment:

        source <virtual_environment_directory>/bin/activate

4. Change to the cloned repository and run the application:

        python3 main.py
